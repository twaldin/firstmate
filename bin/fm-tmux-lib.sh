# fm-tmux-lib.sh — shared tmux pane primitives for firstmate.
#
# ONE source of truth for: busy detection, composer-empty (pending-input)
# detection, and a verify-and-retry-Enter submit. Sourced by both the away-mode
# daemon (bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh) and bin/fm-send.sh so the composer/submit
# logic cannot drift between the two.
#
# Why this exists (incident afk-invx-i5): the daemon's old composer check only
# recognized a BARE prompt glyph ("> ") as an empty composer. claude draws its
# input box with box-drawing borders ("│ > … │"), so every idle claude pane read
# as "pending input" and the away-mode daemon deferred 100% of escalations for
# 9.5 hours with no escape. The detector below strips the box borders before
# deciding, so a bordered-but-empty composer is correctly seen as empty. The same
# corrected detector backs the submit acknowledgement (a submit "landed" iff the
# composer is empty afterward), fixing the parallel false "Enter swallowed".
#
# Ghost text (incident composer-robust): claude renders a predicted-next-prompt
# "suggestion" as dim/faint text inside an otherwise-empty composer. A plain
# capture cannot tell it apart from text a human typed, so the old reader saw an
# idle pane as holding pending input and the daemon deferred injection / firstmate
# misjudged the pane. The composer reader now captures just the cursor line WITH
# ANSI styling (tmux capture-pane -e) and extracts the real typed content with the
# shared, fleet-wide fm_composer_strip_ghost (bin/fm-composer-lib.sh), which drops
# every de-emphasised run - dim/faint (SGR 2) AND a dark/muted truecolor
# foreground - so ghost/placeholder text never counts as real input. The styled
# capture is consumed internally and parsed into a boolean here; it is NEVER
# surfaced (fm-peek and every human/LLM-facing path stay plain), and only the
# single composer row is captured, so no escape-laden pane bulk is produced. This
# is harness-generic: any harness that de-emphasises placeholder/ghost text
# benefits, and the herdr adapter routes through the same owner (task
# afk-herdr-false-pending), so the two backends cannot drift.
#
# Busy-queued Enter (opencode 1.18.4, on the tmux backend only for now): when
# the agent is mid-turn, opencode accepts Enter as a "send when the turn ends"
# keystroke but does NOT clear the composer until then, so the composer keeps
# showing the typed text the whole time. The plain "empty iff composer cleared"
# acknowledgement above false-positives on a swallowed Enter for every steer
# sent to a busy opencode pane, and `fm-send` exits non-zero on a normal
# captain instruction. The submit core now falls back to `fm_pane_is_busy` once
# the Enter-retry budget is spent: a busy pane means the harness accepted and
# queued the Enter (report `empty` so the caller does not re-send), while an
# idle pane keeps the `pending` verdict (a genuine swallow). The herdr backend
# observes the same opencode behavior but needs a separate fix; it is recorded
# as a known gap in `docs/herdr-backend.md` rather than patched here, so the
# tmux adapter does not paper over a herdr-specific shape.
#
# Per-harness override: FM_COMPOSER_IDLE_RE matches an empty composer after
# ghost and structural border stripping. FM_BUSY_REGEX overrides the busy
# footer set (mirrors fm-watch.sh / the daemon).
#
# All functions are `set -u` and `set -e` safe (guarded tmux calls, explicit
# returns) so they can be sourced into either context.
#
# Composer-content classification (empty|pending|unknown, and the fleet-wide
# rule that a BARE shell prompt glyph is a dead shell, not an empty agent
# composer) is NOT owned here: it is the shared bin/fm-composer-lib.sh, sourced
# below and reused by every backend adapter so the decision cannot drift.

#             acknowledgement that a submit landed.
#   pending - real, unsubmitted text on the cursor line (a human mid-typing, or a
#             previous injection whose Enter was swallowed). Defer / retry.
#   unknown - the pane could not be read (tmux error), OR the cursor line is a
#             bare shell prompt (`$`/`%`/`#`/`>`) - a dead shell, not an agent
#             composer, so NOT a safe injection target. The caller decides.
#
# The cursor line is captured WITH ANSI styling (capture-pane -e) and bounded to
# the single composer row (-S/-E). The bordered flag (a genuine composer box) is
# read from the PLAIN row (fm_composer_strip_ansi keeps ghost text so the box
# border is still visible), while the real-typed CONTENT is extracted with the
# shared fm_composer_strip_ghost so dim/faint AND dark-truecolor ghost text drops
# out before classification (grok's dark box border drops with the ghost, which
# is why the bordered flag is read from the plain row, not the ghost-stripped
# one). Both are internal only, never surfaced. The detector strips the harness's
# box-drawing composer borders ("│ … │", heavy "┃", or a plain ASCII "|") using
# literal-string substitution (bash 3.2 safe, locale-independent - no \u escapes,
# no multibyte character classes), and delegates the empty/pending/unknown
# decision to the shared owner fm_composer_classify_content
# (bin/fm-composer-lib.sh). The bordered flag is what lets a bordered `│ > │`
# (claude's own idle composer) or OMP's rounded input box read empty while a bare,
# unbordered `$ ` dead-shell prompt reads unknown.
